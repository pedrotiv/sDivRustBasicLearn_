// Explanations:

// Ownership and References Rules:

// Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
// There can only be one owner at a time.
// When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
// The content of variable in the stack is copied when an assignment occur to another
// The variable in the heap is transferred when an assignment occur but it can be borrowed through
//  a reference prefix '&'
// You can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope
// At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
// References must always be valid.
// References does not have owership
// Another data type that does not have ownership is the slice
